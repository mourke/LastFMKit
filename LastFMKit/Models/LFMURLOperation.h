/**
 A class that allows managing and retrying an NSURLSessionDataTask object.
 
 @note  Pass your `NSURLRequest`  and `NSURLSession` into the objects constructor as well as the callback block to be used to process the API's response. If an error occurs, it will be passed back through the call back which should, in turn be filtered back up to the user and presented using the `localizedRecoverySuggestion`, `localizedRecoveryOptions` and `recoveryAttempter` properties of `NSError`. This class conforms to the NSErrorRecoveryAttempting protocol and the request will be retried upon a successful call.
*/
@interface LFMURLOperation : NSObject

/**
 The callback block to handle the JSON data.
 
 @param responseDictionary  The JSON response converted to a dictionary, if there were no errors.
 @param error                               The error object. This object's userInfo dictionary contains all NSLocalizedRecovery options. To handle an error thrown by the API, use the `localizedRecoverySuggestion`, `localizedRecoveryOptions` and `recoveryAttempter` to show the user information about the error and recover from the error. Calling the `recoveryAttempter` will retry the request with the same callback instance.
