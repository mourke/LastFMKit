 @param trackName   The name of the track.

 @param mbid        The MusicBrainzID for the track.
 @param album       The album that the track is a part of, if any.
 @param position    The track's position in its album (if any). Will be NaN if the track doesn't belong to any album.
 @param URL         The Last.fm URL for the track.
 @param duration    The approximate length (in seconds) of the song.
 @param streamable  A boolean value indicating whether or not the track is streamable.
 @param tags        An array of tags that most accurately describe the track.
 @param wiki        A small amount of information about the track.
 @param listeners   The amount of listeners the track has.
 @param playCount   The amount of "scrobbles" the track has.
 @param timestamp       The date at which the track started playing.
 @param chosenByUser    This parameter is used to indicate when a scrobble comes from a source that the user doesn't have "direct" control over. If the user is listening to music that is effectively chosen by someone other than themselves (e.g. from a Last.fm radio stream; from some other recommendation service; or radio show put together by a DJ or host) then this value should be set to `NO`, otherwise set it to `YES`.
