    /**
    Initialises a new `ScrobbleTrack` object.
    
    - Parameter name:   The name of the track.
    - Parameter artist:  The name of the track's artist.
    - Parameter album:   The name of the album that the track is a part of, if any.
    - Parameter albumArtist: The album artist - if this differs from the track artist.
    - Parameter position:    The track's position in its album (if any).
    - Parameter duration:    The approximate length (in seconds) of the song.
    - Parameter timestamp:       The date at which the track started playing.
    - Parameter chosenByUser:    This parameter is used to indicate when a scrobble comes from a source that the user doesn't have "direct" control over. If the user is listening to music that is effectively chosen by someone other than themselves (e.g. from a Last.fm radio stream; from some other recommendation service; or radio show put together by a DJ or host) then this value should be set to `false`, otherwise set it to `true`.
    
    - Returns:   A `ScrobbleTrack` object.
