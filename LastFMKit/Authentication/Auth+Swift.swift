    /**
     Starts a mobile service session for a user. Session keys have an infinite lifetime by default so this method need only be called once at the very start of your application, unless the user revokes privileges for your application on their Last.fm settings screen. Upon success, the `Session` object passed into the `block` parameter will also be stored in the user's keychain and set as the `session` property on this class as well as the shared singleton instance on the `Session` class itself. For any subsiquent app launches, this method need not be called as the session object will automatically be loaded from the user's keychain.
     
     - Parameter username:    The last.fm username or email address.
     - Parameter password:    The password in plaintext.
     - Parameter callback:    The block called upon completion indicating success or failure.
     
     - Returns: The `URLSessionDataTask` object from the web request.
