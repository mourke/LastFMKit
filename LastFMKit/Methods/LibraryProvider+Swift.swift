    /**
     Retrieves a list of all the artists in a user's library, with play counts and tag counts.
     
     - Parameter username:    The user whose library is to be fetched.
     - Parameter page:        The page of results to be fetched. Must be between 1 and 10,000. Defaults to 30.
     - Parameter limit:       The maximum number of artists to be returned by each page. Keep in mind the larger the limit, the longer the request will take to both process and fetch. Must be between 1 and 10,000. Defaults to 30.
     - Parameter callback:       The callback block containing an optional `LFMError` if the request fails and an array of `Artist`s and an `Query` object if it succeeds.
     
     - Returns:   The `LFMURLOperation` object to be resumed.
